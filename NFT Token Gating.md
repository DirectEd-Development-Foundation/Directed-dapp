<h1> NFT based gated content </h1>

<p> Non-fungible tokens are unique tokens used to register an image, video, or any form of digital item on the blockchain and are stored in cryptocurrency wallets.</p>

<p> In gated content, also referred to as NFT content gating or NFT based restriction, access to contents is restricted and limited to specific visitors. This is done by hiding the data behind NFT restricted portals. These pages or contents are only accessible to donors who hold any of the DirectEd NFT. These NFTs act as a digital key to unlock the gated content or page.</p>

<p> When a user wants to access the gated content or page within the dApp, they would need to hold the specific NFT in their Cardano wallet. Using the onconneted function in mesh we would then check the user's wallet(assets) to see if they have the necessary NFT to access the content. If they do, they would be granted access to the content or page.</p>

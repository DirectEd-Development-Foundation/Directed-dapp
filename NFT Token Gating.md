<h1> NFT based gated content </h1>

<p> Non-fungible tokens are unique tokens used to register an image, video, or any form of digital item on the blockchain and are stored in cryptocurrency wallets.</p>

<p> In gated content, also referred to as NFT content gating or NFT based restriction, access to contents is restricted and limited to specific visitors. This is done by hiding the data behind NFT restricted portals. These pages or contents are only accessible to donors who hold any of the DirectEd NFT. These NFTs act as a digital key to unlock the gated content or page.</p>

<p> When a user wants to access the gated content or page within the dApp, they would need to hold the specific NFT in their Cardano wallet. Using the onconneted function in mesh we would then check the user's wallet(assets) to see if they have the necessary NFT to access the content. If they do, they would be granted access to the content or page.</p>

<h2> DirectEd NFT Gated Contents/Pages </h2>

<ol>
  <li>Donors Portal</li>
  <li>Teachers Portal</li>
  <li>Student's Progress</li>
</ol>

<h4>Donors Portal</h4>

<p>The DirectEd Donors portal is a gated page and can only be accessed by donors with DirectEd NFT (or policyID). It contains DirectEd art collections for higher donors and special stories for each art.</p>

<h4>Teacher's Portal</h4>

<p>The Teachers Portal is another restricted page and can only be accessed by higher users or donors with the DirectEd NFT. The Teachers portal contains 
each students progress, eligibility status of each student and tokens issued to students. Milestone for each student is also recorded here. </p>

<h4>Student's Progress Pages</h4>

<p>The Student's Progress page contains information about how far the student has gone and the current status or progress of the student. Donors are automatically redirected to this page after successfully dontation to a school of their choice.</p>

<h2> Tech Used and How this is done </h2>

<h4>Technologies</h4>
<p>Meshsdk/core, Next.js, NMKR, Blockfrost API and Cardano wallets</p>

<ol>
  <li>Meshsdk/core to build a decentralized app (dApp) on top of the Cardano blockchain. Meshsdk/core is a framework for building decentralized applications that         provides tools and libraries for interacting with the Cardano blockchain.</li>

  <li>Next.js to create the frontend of the dApp and write the logic to restric users. Next.js is a popular frontend development framework that allows for server-side    rendering and can be used to create responsive and dynamic user interfaces.</li>
  
  <li>NMKR: Upload NFTs and make them available for purchase in the dapp with nmkr payment links</li>
  
  <li>Blockfrost API: Check user address for available NFTs. Parse the response from the API to retrieve information about any NFTs associated with the address. The response will be in JSON format and will contain information about the address, including a list of any NFTs associated with that address.</li>

  <li>Use Cardano Browser wallets such as Eternl, Flint and Typhoon to store and trade the NFTs. The function and rules created in 2 using Mesh(getassets) and NextJs     would ensure that only users who hold the necessary NFTs in their Cardano wallets would be able to access the gated content or page within the dApp.</li>

<h2> DirectEd Contribution Using NFT Gated pages to the Cardano Blockchain/Network</h2>
<p>By creating Cardano NFT gated pages or contents using meshsdk/core, Next.js, the Cardano blockchain, and Cardano wallets has the potential to make several contributions to the Cardano blockchain ecosystem:</p>

<p><b>Build on this code:</b> DirectEd codebase is available as an open source project and anyone out there can build on this technology, improve it or even update it, giving access to young developers and startups who want to do the gated pages a boiler plate or template to work with.</p> 

<p><b>Increased Adoption:</b> By providing a way for artists, content creators, and developers to monetize their work and provide exclusive content, the creation of Cardano NFT gated pages or contents could attract more users to the Cardano blockchain. This could lead to increased adoption of Cardano as a platform for creating and exchanging digital assets.</p>

<p><b>Increased Use Cases:</b> The creation of Cardano NFT gated pages or contents demonstrates the versatility of the Cardano blockchain and its ability to support a wide range of applications beyond just cryptocurrency. This could inspire developers to explore new use cases for the Cardano blockchain and contribute to its growth.</p>

<p><b>Increased Security:</b> By leveraging the decentralized and immutable nature of the Cardano blockchain, the creation of Cardano NFT gated pages or contents could provide a more secure and transparent way for artists and content creators to monetize their work and for users to access exclusive content. This could help to build trust in the Cardano ecosystem and contribute to its long-term success.</p>

<p><b>Increased Innovation:</b> The use of meshsdk/core, Next.js, and other technologies to create Cardano NFT gated pages or contents could inspire developers to explore new and innovative ways to build decentralized applications on the Cardano blockchain. This could lead to the creation of new tools, libraries, and frameworks that could benefit the entire Cardano ecosystem.</p>

<p>In Summary, the creation of Cardano NFT gated pages or contents using meshsdk/core, Next.js, the Cardano blockchain, and Cardano wallets has the potential to contribute to the growth, adoption, security, and innovation of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.</p>

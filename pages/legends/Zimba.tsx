						<p className='text-gray-700 text-base'>
							The heroic lion by the name Zimba stands out to stun numbers of
							people. This is due to its pivotal and heroic actions in saving
							Africans from the wraiths and melancholic suffering imposed to
							them by the whites. Zimba has its origin in the famous Tsavo
							national park. Zimba grew up strong. Regardless of the hand to
							mouth life it went through including problems in hunting, its life
							still went on. Nudged by survival instincts, Zimba traversed lands
							and came to a village near the famous Timbuktu forest. Zimba was
							always frequently alarmed and witnessed Africans in the village
							being harassed by Europeans. During one night, as the European
							troops trodden down the villages maneuvering to get laborers,
							Zimba was spotted. Three troop men caught a glimpse of it and were
							filled with desire to slay it. They chased its silhouette into the
							black forest, burning with fury to kill Zimba. Zimba fortunately
							evaded the irksome chase by slipping into a strange cave. As it
							was resting after a tiresome day, Zimba saw a glow from a crack of
							the cave with a feminine curiosity, Zimba approached the glow but
							upon touching it, she was thrown back with a vindictive force.
							Zimba passed out and came in later early in the morning. Zimba
							noticed an abnormal restructure in its body and could not place
							the course. Zimba felt thrice stronger eyes glowing and would
							reach a target point at a supersonic speed. On one sunny afternoon
							as Zimba was trailing past the bulbows and gigantic forest trees
							it came across a troupe of other lions gracing a walk at the
							forest. Zimba was a stranger and a foreigner to the troops and as
							a result she was repelled. With an agility of a cobra, Zimba
							pounced on one approaching masculine giant lion which was
							ultimately the leader of the troop with a heavy punch the leader
							lion fell flat breathing in nerve jerking pain, with all this
							Zimba became feared. Zimba organized a trooper with ten lions and
							went to maneuver into a life saving mission. Zimba attacked whites
							and tore them into pieces; the other nine members also gained
							momentum and did the same. Many missions of the whites in the trek
							of african colonization were destroyed leaving the layout of
							europeans futile. Many Europeans feared the villagers surrounding
							the forest and the villages surrounding the forest. With terrible
							speed it would escape bullets and kill the killers themselves.
							Through her efforts Africans in the Timbuktu area gained morale
							for fighting for their independence. Unfortunately powerful Zimba
							out of trusting her own trope members got tricked and was led into
							a whiteman trap by one of the members. She was killed and
							villagers took the body, performed some rituals and preserved the
							body. It is believed that through Zimba they got new strength and
							zeal to venture into daily activities.{' '}

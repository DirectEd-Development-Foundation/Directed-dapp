",(0,o.jsx)("br",{}),"At the tender age of fifteen, his father, the leader of the Kingdom of Timua, suddenly died of a mysterious illness that has never been known. Since the monarchy was hereditary he, being the first born son, was to take charge immediately. However, contrary to his father, he was a timid and rather shy creature, with absolutely zero leadership skills. Because of this, a neighboring village that had been yearning to attack the Kingdom of Timua but had failed to do so before, took this advantage. They wreaked havoc and distraction. It was this time when Lingaro was a witness of the murder of his relatives. The cold blood of his relatives catalyzed his cowardice and eventually led to him running away. However, a guard of the castle noted his disappearance and using Ligaro’s footsteps managed to trace him in remote Vale. Lingaro refused to go back to the castle where he had lived, claiming he was not fit for the throne. However the guard knew it was high time to reveal a long-running secret in the royal family’s blood: the shield sovereignty. This was a shield that was bestowed upon any new leader and which had magic from the ancestors that enabled the shield to rule with fairness. It had three badges; one on the left for courage, one on the right for loyalty and one on the center for leadership.

These series of events may be lost and found in a distant land, long after Ligaro’s reign, but it shall serve as a reminder that there once was a great leader named Ligaro with a not-so-great backstory..

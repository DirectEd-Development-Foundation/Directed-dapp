He became fearless and merciless . He had an ardent ambition to always take the extra step which no one else in their right mind was willing to. He was not only physically fit and fearless but also had no weakness as his heart clouded his judgment. His ardent ambition to seek recognition made him put everything behind him for the sake of the community. His ruthless and merciless character never withstanding atrocities committed against him and his kinsmen made him the most revered heroes of the community. His past of abandonment was always brought up making him feel inferior, frail and vulnerable. However strong he was, mentally he was frail. He took this as an opportunity to become better and accomplish more. His eyes glowed with passion and desire to not only be the most feared but the best and devoted warrior to ever walk on earth. His sheer determination made him a sole sojourner who always carried his community on his back not caring about anyone’s wishes',

His eyes were always bloodshot and his boiling anger was thought to overflow from his sharp ears. The cat was known to slaughter herds of buffalos using his lightning speed and overwhelming strength. He bullied elephants and rhinos who were helpless against him. He filled graveyards at will with the lives of innocent hyenas till they were no more. At the prime of his tyrannical reign arose ambition in a young lion, Mareo Ngama, the Lion Kingdom heir. Saddened by the blood and tears shed by his loyal subjects, he challenged Paka Power to a duel by the watering hole under the full moon in the presence of all animals. Armed with nothing but his wits and lion strength, he was ready. At last! The fight began. Paka power terrorized Ngwenyama with his powerful punches and merciless kicks. Ngwenyama was no match with powerful Paka Power, and was left lying on the ground crying unto his dead ancestors for help . Paka power took this mighty moment to blow his own trumpet saying how he commanded all oceans. When Paka power turned his back, Mareo Ngama had the perfect counter attack. He slashed open Paka powers belly and pulled out his intestines. He pulled out his throat using his long canines, Paka’s body lay lifeless on the ground as the crowd shouted in celebration. Mareo Ngama let out an awesome roar to seal his position as the new king of the jungle. Long live the king!',

Many years back, he refused to attack innocents lions during one of the many wars fought by the Yoxan army and deserted the army. He had earned great respect from his fellow soldiers that his superiors could neither execute him nor jail him in fear of those loyal to Sahara. Instead, they chose to make him an outcast, first expelling him from the cities and then slowly spreading lies about him. At the time, the Yoxa kingdom was ruled by an despotic leader, King Yander, who ruled the kingdom as a dictator. His rule was highly detested by the lions of the kingdom. There was need for a hero who would take it upon himself and save the kingdom. Lions from all around the kingdom complained for a long time about Yander but could do nothing since he was strong and fierce. Some heroic lions tried to fight Yander and save the kingdom but were mercilessly torn apart. Cries of Yoxa lions were finally heard. After years of living as an outcast, Sahara had honed his skills and mastered the art of war. Hearing the people’s cries for help, Sahara decided to challenge Yander and free the people of Yoxa from the tyranny of Yander. Sahara returned and challenged Yander in front of all the lions of Yoxa leaving Yander with no choice but to accept. On the day of the challenge, Yander immensely bragged about how strong he was and how he would defeat and kill Sahara for challenging him. However, Sahara had trained for years and despite the many advantages Yander had given himself in the form of magic and weaponry, the battle was quickly over. Sahara broke Yander’s bones and killed the tyrant mercilessly. All the lions of Yoxa were amazed by the strength of Sahara and from that day onwards, Sahara was hailed as the great hero that had freed Yoxa from a tyrant. Many wanted Sahara to take the throne, but this was not what Sahara wanted. For years to come, he remained the guardian of Yoxa, ready to defend whenever enemies challenged them.',

Having ruled the kingdom of Timua for fifty-five years, his backstory would nearly be forgotten if it were not for this brief biography. At the tender age of fifteen, his father, the leader of the Kingdom of Timua, suddenly died of a mysterious illness that has never been known. Since the monarchy was hereditary he, being the first born son, was to take charge immediately. However, contrary to his father, he was a timid and rather shy creature, with absolutely zero leadership skills. Because of this, a neighboring village that had been yearning to attack the Kingdom of Timua but had failed to do so before, took this advantage. They wreaked havoc and distraction. It was this time when Lingaro was a witness of the murder of his relatives. The cold blood of his relatives catalyzed his cowardice and eventually led to him running away. However, a guard of the castle noted his disappearance and using Ligaro’s footsteps managed to trace him in remote Vale. Lingaro refused to go back to the castle where he had lived, claiming he was not fit for the throne. However the guard knew it was high time to reveal a long-running secret in the royal family’s blood: the shield sovereignty. This was a shield that was bestowed upon any new leader and which had magic from the ancestors that enabled the shield to rule with fairness. It had three badges; one on the left for courage, one on the right for loyalty and one on the center for leadership. With this, the guard confirmed Ligaro to go back to the castle. As soon as the shield was on Ligaro’s body, he left a sudden Aura of authority. This was it; a new era had begun. Ligaro was Timua’s new ruler and all other kingdoms had to mind their own business or face the music. These series of events may be lost and found in a distant land, long after Ligaro’s reign, but it shall serve as a reminder that there once was a great leader named Ligaro with a not-so-great backstory.',

Kajhel Zimba was always frequently alarmed and witnessed Nolians in the village being harassed by invaders from a foreign kingdom, the white Teluji. During one night, as the Epkal troops trodden down the villages manoeuvring to get labourers, Kajhel was spotted. Three Epkal warriors caught a glimpse of Kajhel and immediately lunged to kill her. They chased its silhouette into the black forest, burning with fury to kill Zimba. Kajhel fortunately evaded the irksome chase by slipping into a strange cave. As it was resting after a tiresome day, Kajhel saw a glow from a crack of the cave with curiosity, Kajhel approached the glow but upon touching it, she was thrown back with a vindictive force. Kajhel passed out and came in later early in the morning. Zimba noticed an abnormal restructure in its body and could not place the course. Zimba felt thrice stronger eyes glowing and would reach a target point at a supersonic speed. On one sunny afternoon as Zimba was trailing past the bulbous and gigantic forest trees it came across a troupe of other lions gracing a walk in the forest. Kajhel was a stranger and a foreigner to the troops and as a result, she was repelled. With an agility of a cobra, Kajhel pounced on one approaching masculine giant lion which was ultimately the leader of the troop with a heavy punch the leader lion fell flat breathing in nerve-jerking pain, with all this Kajhel became feared. Kajhel organized a trooper with ten lions and went to manoeuvre into life-saving mission. Kajhel attacked the white Teluji troops and tore them into pieces; the other nine members also gained momentum and did the same. Many missions of the whites in the trek of Noli colonization were destroyed leaving the layout of Europeans futile. Many Europeans feared the villagers surrounding the forest and the villages surrounding the forest. With terrible speed, it would escape bullets and kill the killers themselves. Through her efforts, Nolians in the Teluji area gained morale for fighting for their independence. Unfortunately, powerful Kajhel out of trusting her own trope members got tricked and was led into an ambush by one of her own. She was killed and villagers took the body, performed some rituals and preserved the body. It is believed that through Kajhel they got new strength and zeal to venture into daily activities.',

Tales were told and passed down from parents to offsprings of how the lion ancestors brought the kingdom to dominance and gave it independence. They also ruled the kingdom in peace and prosperity, that is, until the ancestors of the hyenas forcefully took over the rule of the kingdom by taking advantage of the lion king's trust and poisoned him.

Little did the hyenas know that a hero would rise and challenge their rule, from the smallest pack of the lions, a female cub named Tanya was born. Tanya grew up believing in the tales passed down to her from her grandmother and ended up despising the hyenas for their cruel and inhumane use of power. She was a firm believer of justice and peace but because of her assertive way of thinking, she ended up being treated as an outcast by other members of the community.

It was when those effects became visible that Kaleen decided to take matters to her own paws. She tried to plead with the king but that led to further realizing that the pride no longer had a king but in place a monster. Even after stating the facts that other lions were dying in bloody wars due to unstable thirst for power and the pride was stricken with hunger and last but not least all the surrounding prides hating them. Kaleen saw that this could no longer go on she decided to overthrow the mad king. One fateful night she ensured that the king's guard had gone for their leave. She challenged him to a duel but only later realized she was greatly disadvantaged. However what she couldn't match in strength and raw power she countered with speed, intellect and agility. It was a fierce  battle but good prevailed. The pride welcomed her as the new queen and banished the former king. At once Kaleen put her paws to restoring pride, honor and respect. She also made sure that the pride number increased and that war was a last result of settling disputes. Her stories are told and are to always be told to act with the wisdom of Kaleen.",

			"As he sat on his throne with a majestic posture and released an aura of authority, Mirca darted his eyes on the holy sceptre that bore a dragon's head and symbolized authority over the three realms, and could not believe that he had made it there. ‘’All hail king Mirca, all hail your Majesty;” roared the angels and deities and of the heavenly realm. It had not been a smooth journey for him to receive all that glory but he had to walk through fire to reach there. Before he was born, during the eleventh century, the Epkal state had been ruled by the vicious Faizal - a leader with ambition and hunger for power. The three major kingdoms at the time, Teluji, Kariala and Yoxa, had co-existed peacefully for decades when Faizal began his rebellion against his three masters. Faizal was successful. With his new technology and strategic mastermind, he defeated the major kingdomes one by one. Soon, the Epkal Kingdom had subjugated all of the other kingdoms. Faizal ruled barbarously for the next three decades, detaining the Gods of the other three kingdoms. But in prison, the goddess of Teluji, Queen Mother of the Snow, Metisa, conceived and bore a son, Mirca. In fear of the ruthlessness of King Faizal, she had to send her one and only son away. She named him Mirca and drained him through the heavenly gallows. Some slaves picked him up and decided to nurture him in his growth. He was very unique of course, from the others and he noticed the oppressive rule of Faizal’s soldiers. Slowly, he began advocating against them and began convincing the heroes of the realm that they needed to fight back. At the same time, Faizal’s thirst for power took him to go beyond the technologies he had mastered, and into the realm of dark magic. Faizal was preparing a spell that would sacrifice the Teluji Queen mother of the Snow in order to grant him more power. This was madness, and even the most loyal heroes of the realm could not stand this. Mirca was only a teenager but he bravely led the rebellion, and within a fortnight, the realm was filled with pools of blood and strewn bodies of soldiers. However, they had done it; they had slain Faizal who had wreaked havoc in their realm. It was time to rebuild their home again and that is when all heroes and bowed to the ground and worshipped Mirca as their new King. ‘’I swear on my name to protect this realm with my life.’’ He uttered. ‘’All hail Mirca;’’ they coated.",

			"Yander was born into power. From a young age, he had power. His father was the king of Yoxa, and as his only son, Yander was destined to inherit the throne. Growing up, he was spoiled and indulged, given everything he desired, and taught that he was entitled to everything he wanted. However, his childhood was not entirely happy. Yander's mother died when he was young, and his father, who was consumed by grief, became increasingly distant and neglectful. Yander was left to the care of the palace staff, who indulged him but also feared his temper and tantrums. As he grew older, Yander became more and more ruthless. He had a cruel streak that he directed towards anyone who crossed him, and he was quick to anger and violence. He enjoyed watching others suffer and often ordered executions for minor offenses. Despite his father's attempts to rein him in, Yander continued to indulge in his worst impulses. He surrounded himself with sycophants and flatterers who encouraged his worst behavior, and he began to see himself as invincible, unbeatable, and all-powerful. When Yander finally ascended to the throne, he ruled with an iron fist. He imposed harsh laws and taxes on the people of Yoxa, and anyone who dared to speak out against him was quickly silenced. He became increasingly paranoid and mistrustful, even of his closest advisors, and relied on his own magical abilities to protect himself. It was during this time that Sahara's rebellion began to gain momentum. Yander saw Sahara as a threat to his power, but he also saw him as a personal enemy. He resented Sahara's popularity and the fact that he had been able to defy the Yoxan army and get away with it. When Sahara returned to Yoxa and challenged him, Yander was furious. He saw it as a personal insult and was determined to crush Sahara once and for all. He poured all of his magical power into the fight, but it was not enough. Sahara was too skilled, too determined, and too powerful. In the end, Yander was defeated, and his reign of terror came to an end. But even in death, his legacy lived on. Yoxa was forever changed by his rule, and the scars he left behind would take years to heal.",

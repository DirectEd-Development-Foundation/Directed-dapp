He was not only physically fit and fearless but also had no weakness as his heart clouded his judgment. His ardent ambition to seek recognition made him put everything behind him for the sake of the community. His ruthless and merciless character never withstanding atrocities committed against him and his kinsmen made him the most revered heroes of the community. His past of abandonment was always brought up making him feel inferior, weak and vulnerable. However strong he was, mentally he was frail. He took this as an opportunity to become better, get more accomplishments. His eyes glowed with the passion, the desire to not only be the most feared, but the best warrior to ever walk the earth. His sheer determination made him a sole sojourner but he always carried his community on his back not caring about anyone’s wishes.',

He bullied elephants and rhinos who were helpless against him. He filled graveyards at will with the lives of innocent hyenas till they were no more. At the prime of his tyrannical reign arose ambition in a young lion, Ngwenyama, the Lion Kingdom heir. Saddened by the blood and tears shed by his loyal subjects, he challenged Paka Power to a duel by the watering hole under the full moon in the presence of all animals. Armed with nothing but his wits and lion strength, he was ready. At last! The fight began. Paka power terrorized Ngwenyama with his powerful punches and merciless kicks. Ngwenyama was no match with powerful Paka Power, and was left lying on the ground crying unto his dead ancestors for help . Paka power took this mighty moment to blow his own trumpet saying how he commanded all oceans. When Paka power turned his back, Ngwenyama had the perfect counter attack. He slashed open Paka powers belly and pulled out his intestines. He pulled out his throat using his long canines, Paka’s body lay lifeless on the ground as the crowd shouted in celebration. Ngwenyama let out an awesome roar to seal his position as the new king of the jungle. Long live the king!',

Sarivatak had the head of a lion and a muscular, well-built body of a human. Sarivatak had a pride of lions consisting of nine other lions who always had his back. Sarivatak had for years oppressed humans and enforced his tyrannical rule with the help of other lions. Albeit there were few humans who wanted to resist, there was really nothing they could do. However, one day, one of the lions in Sarivatak's pride, Kavirota felt pity for she witnessed how many succumbed to Sarivatak`s despotic rule and his infamous guillotine. She liaised with some of the humans in order to help save them. They hatched a well-laid out plan which although very risky, would help remove them from sarivatak's rule and power which he had gripped so tenaciously. On the night they had planned the coup, they cautiously approached Sarivatak's tent after he had gone into deep slumber. The tent was usually guarded by lions armed to the teeth but on this night the humans were not so hapless. As they tiptoed towards his bed they were each gripped by so much fear, the air was nearly tangible. One human who was too eager, hurriedly reached for his dagger but dropped it. On hearing this, Sarivatak seized the human and held him so tightly in one arm that life was slowly snuffed out of him. Before Sarivatak could harm anyone else, Kavirota slit his throat and this was the end of his rule.",

Having ruled the kingdom of Timua for fifty-five years, his backstory would nearly be forgotten if it were not for this brief biography. At the tender age of fifteen, his father, the leader of the Kingdom of Timua, suddenly died of a mysterious illness that has never been known. Since the monarchy was hereditary he, being the first born son, was to take charge immediately. However, contrary to his father, he was a timid and rather shy creature, with absolutely zero leadership skills. Because of this, a neighboring village that had been yearning to attack the Kingdom of Timua but had failed to do so before, took this advantage. They wreaked havoc and distraction. It was this time when Lingaro was a witness of the murder of his relatives. The cold blood of his relatives catalyzed his cowardice and eventually led to him running away. However, a guard of the castle noted his disappearance and using Ligaro’s footsteps managed to trace him in remote Vale. Lingaro refused to go back to the castle where he had lived, claiming he was not fit for the throne. However the guard knew it was high time to reveal a long-running secret in the royal family’s blood: the shield sovereignty. This was a shield that was bestowed upon any new leader and which had magic from the ancestors that enabled the shield to rule with fairness. It had three badges; one on the left for courage, one on the right for loyalty and one on the center for leadership. With this, the guard confirmed Ligaro to go back to the castle. As soon as the shield was on Ligaro’s body, he left a sudden Aura of authority. This was it; a new era had begun. Ligaro was Timua’s new ruler and all other kingdoms had to mind their own business or face the music. These series of events may be lost and found in a distant land, long after Ligaro’s reign, but it shall serve as a reminder that there once was a great leader named Ligaro with a not-so-great backstory.',

Nudged by survival instincts, Zimba traversed lands and came to a village near the famous Timbuktu forest. Zimba was always frequently alarmed and witnessed Africans in the village being harassed by Europeans. During one night, as the European troops trodden down the villages maneuvering to get laborers, Zimba was spotted. Three troop men caught a glimpse of it and were filled with desire to slay it. They chased its silhouette into the black forest, burning with fury to kill Zimba. Zimba fortunately evaded the irksome chase by slipping into a strange cave.

Zimba passed out and came in later early in the morning. Zimba noticed an abnormal restructure in its body and could not place the course. Zimba felt thrice stronger eyes glowing and would reach a target point at a supersonic speed. On one sunny afternoon as Zimba was trailing past the bulbows and gigantic forest trees it came across a troupe of other lions gracing a walk at the forest. Zimba was a stranger and a foreigner to the troops and as a result she was repelled. With an agility of a cobra, Zimba pounced on one approaching masculine giant lion which was ultimately the leader of the troop with a heavy punch the leader lion fell flat breathing in nerve jerking pain, with all this Zimba became feared. Zimba organized a trooper with ten lions and went to maneuver into a life saving mission. Zimba attacked whites and tore them into pieces; the other nine members also gained momentum and did the same. Many missions of the whites in the trek of african colonization were destroyed leaving the layout of europeans futile. Many Europeans feared the villagers surrounding the forest and the villages surrounding the forest. With terrible speed it would escape bullets and kill the killers themselves.

Unfortunately powerful Zimba out of trusting her own trope members got tricked and was led into a whiteman trap by one of the members.

Tales were told and passed down from parents to offsprings of how the lion ancestors brought the kingdom to dominance and gave it independence. They also ruled the kingdom in peace and prosperity, that is, until the ancestors of the hyenas forcefully took over the rule of the kingdom by taking advantage of the lion king's trust and poisoned him. Their reason for doing so was unknown, but was believed to be caused by their unstable greed for power. Due to this, they were greatly feared and no one had enough courage to face them. Little did the hyenas know that a hero would rise and challenge their rule, from the smallest pack of the lions, a female cub named Tanya was born. Tanya grew up believing in the tales passed down to her from her grandmother and ended up despising the hyenas for their cruel and inhumane use of power. She was a firm believer of justice and peace but because of her assertive way of thinking, she ended up being treated as an outcast by other members of the community. This is because they feared she would bring trouble to them. Time passed by and Tanya grew up to be a courageous and fearless lioness. She strategized, since her young days, on how the power would be handled by the right animal. She planned to do so by scheming on how to overthrow the hyena king. It took her three years to convince the lions and other animals to fight back through her heroic and heartfelt speeches. Finally, the day they had been longing for was here, the king's birthday, using the lion and lioness soldiers as her troops, and the hares as her informants, she made an ambush when the hyenas were drunk and dazed. Tanya ruthlessly ordered that all adult hyenas be slayed and she battled with the king head on. After a long tustle, she finally slayed Manon to death, bringing to an end his merciless rule. Due to public demand, she was crowned the rightful and first female ruler of Majaliwa kingdom. Up to date, the animals remember her for her successful and heroic leadership.",

			'Kazu. A name bestowed all glory for her heroic deeds. Abandoned and victimized during the great war, and still bears the scars of that war. Her nature encouraged her to be what she was, the greatest among her pride. After the great war, Kazu found herself among the orphaned cubs, and the elderly lions who were left to probe in pain of losing their loved ones. Through combined efforts, Kazu and the other lions worked towards building a new pride, a new empire that would command their share of respect. The pain of losing her husband and her children still made her feel the agony of not being able to help them. Peace prevailed in the society for a long time and they all enjoyed and cherished the harmony. Summer season was coming and the flowers bloomed. Marina the dreaded pride that rained terror on other small empires was advancing to other territories. Kazu knew well that despite the great war that rendered her kingdom powerless, Marina would still attack them. Kazu decided to avoid such a massacre that rendered their village a blood pool. Kazu set out to meet Lufi, Marinas leader, to have peace talks. She knew deep in her heart that she was putting her life on the death row but decided to look at the bigger picture Upon arriving at Marina, Kazu requested to speak to Lufi.

Returning back home, the villagers were proud of her for her heroic deed. She was indeed a heroine. She had brought an end to the great war.',
